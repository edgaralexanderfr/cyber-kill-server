# CONTRIBUTING

## Development

1. Make sure to have a good extension for handling Go in your Text Editor, in case of VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go.
2. In case of not counting on a Go Editor Extension, make sure to run:

```bash
go fmt
```

Before any commit you make to keep consistency along the codebase.

3. You can fork and create pull requests to this project if you want someone's review or you can code directly in the main repo if you want.

## Accessing repo's documentation

You can access the Go's repository documentation by running the following command:

```bash
godoc -http=:6060
```
